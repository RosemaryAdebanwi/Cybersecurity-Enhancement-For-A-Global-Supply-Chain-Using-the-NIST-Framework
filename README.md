# Cybersecurity Enhancement For A Global Supply Chain Using the NIST Framework

<h2>Overview:</h2>
A large manufacturing company needed to secure its global supply chain against cyber threats. As a GRC expert, I applied the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to identify critical vendors, assess risks, and implement key security controls. By enhancing protection and detection capabilities, I strengthened the company's resilience, ensuring a proactive approach to monitoring and responding to cybersecurity incidents.

<h2>Steps:</h2>

- Identified Critical Components and Vendors 
- Assessed and Categorize Risks Using the NIST Framework 
- Developed Cybersecurity Guidelines and Controls for Vendors
- Developed a Monitoring and Response Plan for Cybersecurity Incidents

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

This strategic approach leveraged the NIST CSF to strengthen supply chain cybersecurity by identifying key risks, implementing protective controls, enhancing detection capabilities, and ensuring a robust incident response. Through proactive vendor management and continuous monitoring, the manufacturing company effectively mitigated cybersecurity threats across its global supply chain.
